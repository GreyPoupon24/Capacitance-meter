I created a capacitance meter that measures capacitance from 0.1uf to 1000uf

The programming was done in 8051 assembly
The microcontroller used was an AMTEL AT89LP51IC2
A BO230XS serial USB Adaptor was used to interface with the laptop
An LCD 1602 module was used to display the numbers
A 22.1184MHZ crystal was used for the clock


A 555 timer was used in the astable osscilator configuration with,Ra=980ohm,Rb=979ohm

Measurements were taken with C=0.1uf,10uf,100uf,220uf,1000uf.

An Eligoo UNO R3 microcontroller board was used to provide VCC to the 555 timer from a different source as using the VCC rails seemed to cause the LCD to bug out.
The Eligoo UNO R3 was was chosen because it could also provide 3.3V which was required for the LCD's backlight.

I implimented a button that multiplies or divides the final number by 1000 to cycle units between pf->nf->uf->pf
